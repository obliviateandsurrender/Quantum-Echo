# The Echo

This is team 13 with hackers Haneen Ayar AlArfaj, Joel D'Souza, Abdallah Mohamed Eid Hassan, Zeyad Gomaa, Yashaswi Malla, Kadem khadidja, Raed O. Yousef Ghazal, and Rhea Braithwaite. Team 13 is mentored by Utkarsh and Varun Arora.

## Introduction

In this project, we implement the Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks to train a model for use in our app ECHO.
We will be using QML to enhance OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which will allow us to digitize endangered languages by scanning the documents and converting them to digitally written text, where you can search the documents, literature, find them and keep them safe for the next generations, and its implemented with a minimum cost, energy reserving and great memory performance.
After the application of the quantum convolution layer we feed the resulting features into a classical neural network that will be trained to classify the  different characters of the MNIST dataset.
